Match Em’!

As one can see, my grid mod has come a long way. The game is now more clear and has far more juice, making it a lot more exciting. It also has a systematic way of teaching kids about the different animals and animal groups. Before, unless you recognized the animal, you had no idea what they were. Now you can mouse over them in order to see a larger image and the name of the animal. In addition to this, there are now different levels. In the easy level, the animal borders now match based on the animal group. Also, if the player is idle for 10 seconds, a hint will appear. In the medium version there is no hint but the tiles still have the same border. In the hard version, all the borders are the same and there are no hints. This approach makes it easier for kids to become more familiar with the animals before attempting to match them without any aid. The final version also features more art, and the ability to navigate between pages more easily. If there is one thing I wish I had more time to work on it was the meet the animals page. On that page you would be able to learn specific facts about the individual animals. If I have more time in the future, I will try and add it. In conclusion, my game is far from perfect, but I am still proud of the work I did. When playtesting with the kids they said it was fun, and I could tell that it challenged them, but also allowed them to learn and adapt. To me, that’s a success and I hope maybe one day my game can actually be released and played by kids who are interested in animals like I was as a kid!
